# LIRI-NODE-APP

**What is it:**
Homework #10:
On this assignment I had to make a LIRI. LIRI stands for *Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface.* It is a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.
As demonstrated on the video I linked, I will be using command line to show the results thr LIRI gives back.
The following are the commands I will be inputing for the results:
1. node liri.js **concert-this** "Maggie Rogers"
1. node liri.js **spotify-this-song** "Rise Up"
1. node liri.js **movie-this** "Pretty Woman"
